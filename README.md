# Jumping-square-game-
This is a basic game I made with pygame for the sake of learning and experience. 

Requirements:
You need to install pygame in order to run this game. All the other libraries used come pre-installed with python.

About the game:
Your character is a white box. The objective is to avoid enemy boxex by jumping. Press spacebar to jump.

Note:
I could have added some details by importing some images but as this was my first time making a game, I avoided making things too complex.
